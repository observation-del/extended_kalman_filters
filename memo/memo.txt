Files in the Github src Folder

The files you need to work with are in the src folder of the github repository.

    main.cpp - communicates with the Term 2 Simulator receiving data measurements, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
    FusionEKF.cpp - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
    kalman_filter.cpp- defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
    tools.cpp- function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix

The only files you need to modify are FusionEKF.cpp, kalman_filter.cpp, and tools.cpp.
How the Files Relate to Each Other

Here is a brief overview of what happens when you run the code files:

    Main.cpp reads in the data and sends a sensor measurement to FusionEKF.cpp
    FusionEKF.cpp takes the sensor data and initializes variables and updates variables. The Kalman filter equations are not in this file. FusionEKF.cpp has a variable called ekf_, which is an instance of a KalmanFilter class. The ekf_ will hold the matrix and vector values. You will also use the ekf_ instance to call the predict and update equations.
    The KalmanFilter class is defined in kalman_filter.cpp and kalman_filter.h. You will only need to modify 'kalman_filter.cpp', which contains functions for the prediction and update steps.
